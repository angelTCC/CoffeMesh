# 🚀 Full-Stack Model Deployment

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **pretrained regression** from Hugging Face for predicting numerical values (like energy consumption or crop yield) through a fully functional web application.

The main goals are to:

- Serve a powerful pretrained model using **FastAPI** backend  
- Create an interactive **React** frontend for easy user input and instant prediction display  
- Package the backend and frontend as **Docker containers** for portability  
- Deploy and scale the application with **Kubernetes** for real-world production readiness  

This workflow mimics professional ML engineering pipelines, focusing on **model deployment, API design, and container orchestration** rather than training from scratch.

## ⚙️ What Does This Project Do?

1. **Model Serving:**  
   Loads a pretrained tabular regression model from Hugging Face Hub that can predict continuous values based on tabular input features. For example, estimating future energy usage or crop yields without needing to train the model yourself.

2. **Backend API:**  
   Implements a RESTful API using FastAPI that accepts JSON input representing features, runs the model inference, and returns predictions in JSON format. The API is fast, asynchronous, and production-ready.

3. **Frontend User Interface:**  
   Provides a React-based web interface where users can input relevant feature data through forms and get prediction results instantly. This improves usability for non-technical users or demo purposes.

4. **Containerization with Docker:**  
   Both backend and frontend are containerized, ensuring consistent environments and easy deployment anywhere—from local machines to cloud servers.

5. **Orchestration with Kubernetes:**  
   The entire stack is deployed on Kubernetes, enabling easy scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance—essential for production-level applications.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Go to the `backend/` directory  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the FastAPI server locally:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
4. Test the API endpoint:
   * `POST /predict` — Send JSON with tabular features, receive predictions


### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory
2. Install npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Use the web interface to enter data and get model predictions

### Docker & Kubernetes Deployment

1. Build Docker images for backend and frontend:

   ```bash
   docker build -t yourusername/backend:latest ./backend
   docker build -t yourusername/frontend:latest ./frontend
   ```

2. Push images to your container registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.)

3. Apply Kubernetes manifests to deploy the app:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

4. Access your app through the configured Kubernetes ingress or service URL

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add validation and error feedback for user inputs
* Implement batch predictions for large datasets
* Add user authentication and logging
* Integrate monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
* Create CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
